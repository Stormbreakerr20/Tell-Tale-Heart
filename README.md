Platform for Student Gymkhana Office:

Approval Automation:
Any event or purchase goes through the following procedure:

The request is generated by the respective club.
The request is recommended by the corresponding secretary.
The request is approved by the respective club FA.
The request is recommended by the Society FA.
After approval by the Society FA, the request becomes visible to the Students Office.
The request is approved by the chairSAP.
Additionally, for purchases:

Any purchase below 15,000 can be made through Club FA.
Club FA can approve up to 15K and a total of 15K in a month.
Society FA can approve up to 15K and a total of 15K in a month.
If the amount is more than 15K but less than 50K, the approval chain will be Secretary > Club FA > Society FA > chairSAP. chairSAP has no monthly limit.
If the amount exceeds 50K, the approval chain will be Secretary > Club FA > Society FA > chairSAP > Dean Students.
Request Generation:
Clubs put a request explaining the need for approval. The portal supports text and attachments. The request includes a field for monetary aspects, if any, or None. Once all approvals are done, the Student's office receives an automated form with fields auto-filled from the initial request. The data is saved to an external spreadsheet accessible by the Students office.

Viewing Permissions:

Society secretaries and FAs can access the approval chain and total funds used for their society.
Clubs and their FAs can access approvals/expenses for their club, including total funds used.
ChairSAP, Dean Students, and Student Office can see any approval chain for any society.
Priority and Timeline:
Requests can be normal or urgent. Normal priority requests can remain pending for a maximum of 3 days excluding weekends. Urgent requests need processing within 24 hours except on weekends. Society FA/club FA decides urgency.

Conversation Chain:
Concerned authorities can make comments at any approval point in the chain.

Report Generation:
After all approvals, a report is generated containing all information for that approval, preferred in PDF format.

Security and Interface:

Database security is ensured.
Access is restricted to specific users.
A friendly user interface is provided.
Dynamic Data Management:
Clubs, societies, and their FAs can be added/removed anytime. The administrator (ChairSAP) has the authority for these dynamic changes. A society can approve 15K per month, not per club.

Example:
A request for 14K approval for equipment by Yantrik club follows the approval chain, visible to the Student's Office after all approvals. If a request exceeds monthly limits or is urgent, the approval chain is adjusted accordingly.
